# chordexport

This is a simple tool to import chords (or similarly formatted HTML?) and show them in the UNIX shell and/or make them more edit-friendly.

More precisely: it reformats HTML when text and other super-positioned text (`<sup>`) are used together, by splitting text and super-positioned stuff on two separate lines.

** Usage **

`./chordexport.sh <url>`
